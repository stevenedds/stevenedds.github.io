First, an exploration company needs to dig for and find oil, using energy to do so. Remember, that oil as an “energy source” has only been stored. The energy in oil initially came through plants that absorbed their own energy from the sun through photosynthesis, and through animals that absorbed their energy by feeding on the plants. All of that energy originally came from the sun. That oil needs to be pumped from the ground (requiring energy) and transported (requiring energy) to an oil refinery, where it undergoes a conversion (requiring energy) to gasoline. That gasoline then needs to be transported (requiring energy) to a regional gas station where you fill your car. Even the most efficient internal combustion engines only convert between 25 and 50 percent of the energy in gasoline into moving the car; up to 75 percent of the energy is emitted as heat and carbon dioxide and released into the atmosphere."},{"id":2,"date":"2018-11-27 18:22:40","book":"How to Be Well","author":"Frank, M.D. Lipman","text":"1.

Information about those vehicles was then sent back to Uber and stored in a database. “Hell” created a way for Uber to monitor the real-time positions of Lyft drivers. And because many of those drivers worked for Uber as well, Uber could monitor the rates Lyft was offering for drivers and outbid them, thereby swaying drivers to work more regularly for Uber. “Hell,” as Sullivan saw it, was sneaky.

Digestive distress in particular might be caused by a deficiency in lactase, the enzymes required to break down milk sugars smoothly.

By repeating in your mind “Tonight I will fly” as often as possible, you increase the chance that you will have a flying dream. After all, we all tend to dream about whatever most occupies our mind, whether work, family—or flying.\nAllow yourself to sleep as late as possible each morning. The longer you sleep, the more vivid dreams tend to become, and the better the chances that you will remember them.\nWhen you awaken, do not roll over or get up. Keeping your head still, lie quietly and try to remember your dreams. The longer you try, the more you will remember. Spend at least ten minutes on this every morning.\nKeep a dream log.

A calorie is simply a unit of energy.

Food first enters the stomach, where it is mixed with stomach acid and slowly released into the small intestine. Nutrients are extracted throughout the journey through the small and large intestines. What remains is excreted as stool.\nProteins are broken down into their building blocks, amino acids. These are used to build and repair the body’s tissues, and the excess is stored. Fats are directly absorbed into the body. Carbohydrates are broken down into their building blocks, sugars. Proteins, fats and carbohydrates all provide caloric energy for the body, but differ greatly in their metabolic processing.

Unfortunately, these mono- and diglycerides are quickly converted by the body back into triglycerides, which are associated with heart disease.

As discussed before, a hormone acts on a cell as a key that fits into a lock. When insulin (the key) no longer fits into the receptor (the lock), the cell is called insulin resistant. Because the fit is poor, the door does not open fully. As a result, less glucose enters. The cell senses that there is too little glucose inside. Instead, glucose is piling up outside the door. Starved for glucose, the cell demands more. To compensate, the body produces extra keys (insulin). The fit is still poor, but more doors are opened, allowing a normal amount of glucose to enter.\nSuppose that in the normal situation we produce ten keys (insulin). Each key opens a locked door that lets two glucose molecules inside. With ten keys, twenty glucose molecules enter the cell. Under conditions of resistance, the key does not fully open the locked door. Only one glucose molecule is allowed in. With ten keys, only ten glucose molecules are allowed in. To compensate, we now produce a total of twenty keys. Now, twenty glucose molecules are allowed in, but only because we have increased the number of keys. As we develop insulin resistance, our bodies increase our insulin levels to get the same result—glucose in the cell. However, we pay the price in constantly elevated insulin levels."},{"id":951,"date":"2017-07-23 20:43:41","book":"The Obesity Code","author":"Dr. Jason Fung","text":"What we find instead is that a sudden reduction of Calories In causes a similar reduction in Calories Out, and no weight is lost as the body balances its energy budget"},{"id":952,"date":"2017-09-06 05:28:01","book":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck","author":"Mark Manson","text":"The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it."},{"id":954,"date":"2017-08-01 04:52:28","book":"Wired to Eat","author":"Robb Wolf","text":"If you are at all hypertensive, I do recommend that you perform weekly monitoring.

Cortisol, part of a class of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids (glucose + cortex + steroid), is produced in the adrenal cortex. In Paleolithic times, the stress that led to a release of cortisol was often physical: for instance, being chased by a predator. Cortisol is essential in preparing our bodies for action—to fight or flee.\nOnce released, cortisol substantially enhances glucose availability,1 which provides energy for muscles—very necessary in helping us to run and avoid being eaten. All available energy is directed toward surviving the stressful event. Growth, digestion and other long-term metabolic activities are temporarily restricted. Proteins are broken down and converted to glucose (gluconeogenesis).\nVigorous physical exertion (fight or flight) soon often followed, burning up these newly available stores of glucose. Shortly thereafter, we were either dead, or the danger was past and our cortisol decreased back to its normal low levels.\nAnd that’s the point: the body is well adapted to a short-term increase in cortisol and glucose levels.

These were the headquarters of Blockbuster, then a $6 billion giant that dominated the home entertainment business with almost nine thousand rental stores around the world.\nThe CEO of Blockbuster, John Antioco, who was reputed to be a skilled strategist aware that a ubiquitous, super-fast internet would upend the industry, welcomed us graciously. Sporting a salt-and-pepper goatee and an expensive suit, he seemed completely relaxed.\nBy contrast, I was a nervous wreck. Marc and I had cofounded and now ran a tiny two-year-old start-up, which let people order DVDs on a website and receive them through the US Postal Service. We had one hundred employees and a mere three hundred thousand subscribers and were off to a rocky start. That year alone, our losses would total $57 million. Eager to make a deal, we’d worked for months just to get Antioco to respond to our calls.\nWe all sat down around a massive glass table, and after a few minutes of small talk, Marc and I made our pitch. We suggested that Blockbuster purchase Netflix, and then we would develop and run Blockbuster.com as their online video rental arm. Antioco listened carefully, nodded his head frequently, and then asked, “How much would Blockbuster need to pay for Netflix?” When he heard our response—$50 million—he flatly declined. Marc and I left, crestfallen.\nThat night, when I got into bed and closed my eyes, I had this image of all sixty thousand Blockbuster employees erupting in laughter at the ridiculousness of our proposal. Of course, Antioco wasn’t interested. Why would a powerhouse like Blockbuster, with millions of customers, massive revenues, a talented CEO, and a brand synonymous with home movies, be interested in a flailing wannabe like Netflix? What did we possibly have to offer that they couldn’t do more effectively themselves?\nBut, little by little, the world changed and our business stayed on its feet and grew. In 2002, two years after that meeting, we took Netflix public. Despite our growth, Blockbuster was still a hundred times larger than we were ($5 billion versus $50 million). Moreover, Blockbuster was owned by Viacom, which at that time was the most valuable media company in the world. Yet, by 2010, Blockbuster had declared bankruptcy. By 2019, only a single Blockbuster video store remained, in Bend, Oregon. Blockbuster had been unable to adapt from DVD rental to streaming.\nThe year 2019 was also noteworthy for Netflix. Our film Roma was nominated for best picture and won three Oscars, a great achievement for the director Alfonso Cuarón, which underscored the transformation of Netflix into a full-fledged entertainment company. Long ago, we had pivoted from our DVD-by-mail business to become not just an internet streaming service, with over 167 million subscribers in 190 countries, but a major producer of our own TV shows and movies around the world. We had the privilege of working with some of the world’s most talented creators, including Shonda Rhimes, Joel and Ethan Coen, and Martin Scorsese. We had introduced a new way for people to watch and enjoy great stories, which, in its best moments, broke down barriers and enriched lives.\nI am often asked, “How did this happen? Why could Netflix repeatedly adapt but Blockbuster could not?” That day we went to Dallas, Blockbuster held all the aces. They had the brand, the power, the resources, and the vision. Blockbuster had us beat hands down.\nIt was not obvious at the time, even to me, but we had one thing that Blockbuster did not: a culture that valued people over process, emphasized innovation over efficiency, and had very few controls. Our culture, which focused on achieving top performance with talent density and leading employees with context not control, has allowed us to continually grow and change as the world, and our members’ needs, have likewise morphed around us.\nNetflix is different. We have a culture where No Rules Rules.\nNETFLIX CULTURE IS WEIRD\n\n\nErin Meyer: Corporate culture can be a mushy marshland of vague language and incomplete, ambiguous definitions. What’s worse, company values—as articulated—rarely match the way people behave in reality. The slick slogans on posters or in annual reports often turn out to be empty words.\nFor many years, one of America’s biggest corporations proudly exhibited the following list of values in the lobby of its headquarters: “Integrity. Communication. Respect. Excellence.” The company? Enron. It boasted about having lofty values right up to the moment it came crashing down in one of history’s biggest cases of corporate fraud and corruption.\nNetflix culture, on the other hand, is famous—or infamous, depending on your point of view—for telling it like it is. Millions of businesspeople have studied the Netflix"},{"id":1142,"date":"2019-01-02 05:29:05","book":"Game Changers","author":"Dave Asprey","text":"run away and hide from or kill scary things, eat everything you can, and reproduce"},{"id":1144,"date":"2017-09-06 05:01:14","book":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck","author":"Mark Manson","text":"It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure."},{"id":1145,"date":"2017-08-23 06:00:34","book":"Wired to Eat","author":"Robb Wolf","text":"The contents of the stomach squirt into the small intestine"},{"id":1146,"date":"2017-07-25 04:31:30","book":"The Obesity Code","author":"Dr. Jason Fung","text":"red wine does not raise insulin or impair insulin sensitivity, and therefore may be enjoyed.16 Up to two glasses a day is not associated with major weight gain17 and may improve insulin sensitivity.18"},{"id":1147,"date":"2017-08-23 06:01:09","book":"Wired to Eat","author":"Robb Wolf","text":"Ideally, at the end of the process, carbohydrates in the form of starch are reduced to sugars (mainly glucose), while proteins are degraded into amino acids."},{"id":1148,"date":"2018-11-26 20:33:58","book":"The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right","author":"Gawande, Atul","text":"dumb stuff"},{"id":1149,"date":"2018-12-04 15:42:24","book":"Game Changers","author":"Dave Asprey","text":"he would choose more aggressive poses to warm up and then complete a body-weight routine before doing some seated poses and concentration training"},{"id":1150,"date":"2018-12-11 05:22:46","book":"Game Changers","author":"Dave Asprey","text":"being a part of a community was their second most popular piece of advice.

The kitchen was bigger than the dining room - which I liked - but the dining room was pretty empty most times, which I didn't like so much. The crew, not uncommonly for most far-flung outposts in a restaurant empire, were already used to being the neglected bastard offspring, largely ignored by their leader. Supplies, which were supposed to arrive from New York, were sporadic. Guidance, such as it was, was erratic in the extreme. I was told immediately that another chef had just preceded me. He had set up a menu, showed the recent culinary graduate cooks how to dunk pasta, and then quit.\nMy first night, I slept in a vacationing waiter's apartment. It was a strange bed, with a strange cat, in a shabby, two-family Victorian. I lay awake, kicking and scratching, swatting the cat at my feet. The next day, I was brought over to the official residence of visiting dignitaries from New York: a three-story townhouse, brand-new but built to look old, in the center of the fake historical district. It was pretty swank: wall-to-wall carpeting, four bathrooms, vast dining room, living room and top-floor studio. The only problem was, there was no furniture. A bare futon lay in the middle of the floor on the third story, a pathetic black and white TV with coat-hanger antenna the only offered amusement. The spacious kitchen contained only some calcified rice cakes. The only other sign that anyone had ever lived there was a lone chef's jacket on a hanger in one of the closets - like an artifact, evidence of an ancient astronaut who'd been here before me.\nIt was make-work, and I knew it. The Shadow called to let me know that he wanted me to create a brunch menu and a happy-hour buffet. This was an easy enough assignment, as there were only about three bar customers who spent their evening chatting with the manager; and brunch, such as it was, consisted of about five tables of Sunday tourists who'd wandered into the empty dining room by mistake while window shopping and been too embarrassed to leave after realizing their mistake. The place had been open only a few months and already gave off the distinct odor of doom. Large-scale doom. There were twelve cooks, all new equipment, a bake shop, a pasta-making department. The Silver Shadow had spent million son this colossal monument to hubris and cocaine. And you could see, in the cooks' faces, that they knew - as sure as they knew that they lived in a second-class city - that they'd be out of work soon. The body was dying; only the brain had yet to receive the message.\nI worked fast, spending a lot of time shuttling back and forth to New York to score in bombed-out shooting galleries on the Lower East Side. My pay had never been arranged properly; when I needed money, I simply asked the GM to give me a few hundred, which he seemed happy to do, as money bled quickly out of Gino's every orifice. There was no business at the restaurant, so there was soon nothing to do. When I couldn't make it back to the real city, I'd drink at the Club Charles, an atmospherically crappy dive with a vaguely punk-rock clientele, or watch TV in my lonely room with a view.\nI passed the Baltimore job to Dimitri as soon as I could. Maybe it wasn't the nicest thing I ever did, but it was a chef's job, and the money was good - and hey, room and board was free! Once again, I called the Shadow, told him there was nothing for me to do, and was told in response, 'They need you in New York! Get right back! They're really looking forward to meeting you!'\nWhich is how I found myself in a bathroom full of machine-guns.\nGino's New York, unlike its little brother in Baltimore, was still busy - crazy busy - and in every way, an out-of-control madhouse. If I wasn't already a burnt-out case from four years of drug abuse and two years in a Columbus Avenue pick-up joint and the cumulative effects of my whole checkered career to this point, I was after Gino's. Gino's finished me.\nBrought in as the chef to replace the man whose jacket I'd discovered in Baltimore, I was shocked - even I was shocked - at the level of debauchery and open criminality. On my first day in Gino's New York, I found that the extremely well-paid head of prep could not so much as peel an onion - when he deigned to show up at work at all. When I inquired, I was matter-of-factly informed by the New York GM that he was the boss's coke dealer, kept around so that the boss and upper management could conveniently re-up if their little screwtop bottles ran empty.\nThe GM, a jangly, untrustworthy character, who seemed to be high on quaaludes most of the time, would disappear on benders for days at a time. This was problematic, as he had the only keys to the office. When the local wise guys showed up - as they did every Tuesday - looking for protection money (this kept our delivery trucks from having their tires slashed), we had to jimmy t"},{"id":1700,"date":"2017-06-15 00:18:39","book":"When Genius Failed","author":"Roger Lowenstein","text":"“You’re the reason—because of fools like you we can.”"},{"id":1701,"date":"2018-11-19 15:53:03","book":"59 Seconds: Think a Little, Change a Lot","author":"Richard Wiseman","text":"For example"},{"id":1702,"date":"2017-08-23 01:01:50","book":"Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt","author":"Lewis, Michael","text":"prop group,” he said.

And there were several that voiced a sound objection: The business Brad was pitching to them was a foggy proposition—a stock exchange that existed mainly to route their stock market orders to all the other exchanges. How would that work? Thor had worked great, but why did Brad imagine that the predators who operated with such abandon on America’s public and private exchanges would not adapt to it? And why did he think Wall Street’s biggest banks would subcontract the routing of their stock market orders to his new exchange? Because it was “fair”? The banks’ salesmen ran around every day selling the banks’ own routers. They weren’t going to turn on a dime and say, “Oh yeah, we’ve been paid huge sums of money to sell you out to high-frequency traders, but now we’re going to give all the stock market orders to Brad, so we can’t sell you out any longer.”\nBrad didn’t fully understand the enterprise he needed to create until the market forced him to, by not giving him the capital for the enterprise he thought he wanted to create. Fuller understanding arrived in August 2012, in a meeting with David Einhorn, who ran the hedge fund Greenlight Capital. After listening to Brad’s pitch, Einhorn asked him a simple question: Why aren’t we all just picking the same exchange? Why didn’t investors organize themselves to sponsor a single stock exchange entrusted with guarding their interests and protecting them from Wall Street predators?

Some days I’m a little higher and some a little lower, but I don’t have any major swings in my intake.\n\n• Generally speaking, if your weight is going up on a cut, you’re eating too much or moving too little.\n\n• Your waist measurement (at the navel) shrinking is a reliable sign that you’re losing fat, so if your jeans feel looser, that’s a good sign."},{"id":2136,"date":"2017-10-23 05:41:50","book":"High Performance Habits","author":"Brendon Burchard","text":"If you’d like to go to another level of mastery, try a twenty-minute practice called the Release Meditation Technique (RMT). I’ve trained over two million people on RMT, and all over the world I meet students who consider it one of the most life-changing habits they’ve ever adopted. Just close your eyes, sit up straight, and, breathing deeply, let the tension fall away from your body as you keep repeating the word release to yourself. As thoughts inevitably come up in your mind, don’t try to chase them away or ponder them—just let them go and return to the “release” mantra. The goal of the meditation is to release both physical and mental tension. It helps to have a voice guide you through it with some background music, so just visit YouTube and type in my name and “Release Meditation Technique.”"},{"id":2137,"date":"2018-12-15 22:32:32","book":"Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds","author":"David Goggins","text":"Food was my drug of choice and I always sucked up every last crumb."},{"id":2138,"date":"2021-11-23 05:13:30","book":"The Infinite Machine","author":"Camila Russo","text":"She opened her jewelry box and gave Mihai a gold necklace, one of her most valuable pieces, for him to pawn"},{"id":2139,"date":"2021-12-20 03:13:12","book":"The Real Anthony Fauci","author":"Robert F.

You can laugh at yourself along with them, which disempowers them. If you take what they do or say less personally, they no longer hold any cards. Feelings are just feelings. On the other hand, people who are secure with themselves don’t bully other people. They look out for other people, so if you’re getting bullied you know that you’re dealing with someone who has problem areas you can exploit or soothe. Sometimes the best way to defeat a bully is to actually help them.

I could joke and kid around with the guys. I was fairly comfortable talking to new acquaintances because I wanted to know people and connect and have a good time. But sharing personal matters was another thing. I rarely shared my real thoughts, needs, or dreams with others.\nAbout the same time, I began studying psychology, philosophy, and self-help. I was looking for answers. I wanted to know how to live a better life. As I read more on these topics, I discovered that many of the authors’ journeys were much like mine: Something had happened to them that inspired them to improve their life, explore how to become a better person, and want to help others on that journey. Reading their stories, I felt more compelled to share my own.\nI also noticed that many of these authors listed “lecturer” or “professional speaker” or “workshop facilitator” in their bios. These authors tended to be speakers, so I sought out their audiobooks or speeches online. I began to realize that the better they could speak, the better they could impart their message and inspire others to change.\nAnd so I decided that mastering the skill of public speaking was a must in my life. Sometimes, the desire to serve and to develop the relevant skills to do so outweighs our fears. I got committed and began a process of learning that I call “progressive mastery,” which quickly changed my life.\nWhenever you want to master a skill, you have two choices: You can hope to develop that skill with some practice and repetition, or you can ensure that you become world-class in that skill through progressive mastery."},{"id":2226,"date":"2017-12-03 15:53:11","book":"Tribe of Mentors","author":"Timothy Ferriss","text":"Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond"},{"id":2227,"date":"2021-12-23 05:27:12","book":"The Real Anthony Fauci","author":"Robert F.

One night I ran thirteen miles—the most I’d ever run in my entire life. On that run I came to a familiar intersection. It was the same street where that redneck had pulled a gun on me. I avoided it and ran on, covering a half mile in the opposite direction before something told me to turn back. When I arrived at that intersection a second time, I stopped and contemplated it. I was scared shitless of that street, my heart was leaping from my chest, which is exactly why I suddenly started charging down its fucking throat.\n\nWithin seconds, two snarling dogs got loose and chased me as the woods leaned in on both sides. It was all I could do to stay a step ahead of the beasts. I kept expecting that truck to reappear and run me the fuck down, like some scene from Mississippi circa 1965, but I kept running, faster and faster, until I was breathless. Eventually the hounds of Hell gave up and loped off, and it was just me, the rhythm and steam of my breath, and that deep country quiet. It was cleansing. By the time I turned back, my fear was gone. I owned that fucking street."},{"id":2384,"date":"2018-03-12 03:45:33","book":"High Performance Habits","author":"Brendon Burchard","text":"What can I be excited about today?\nWhat or who might trip me up or cause stress, and how can I respond in a positive way, from my highest self?\nWho can I surprise today with a thank-you, a gift, or a moment of appreciation?"},{"id":2385,"date":"2021-11-04 03:39:49","book":"The Grid","author":"Gretchen Bakke","text":"For places with mountains, there is “pumped hydro.” It’s a sort of man-made dry lakebed near an existing hydroelectric dam.

Here is how it works: imagine you start with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds; then the stock market plunges, so you find yourself with 45% in stocks and 55% in bonds. You’d rebalance by selling bonds and buying stocks. As Princeton professor Burton Malkiel told Tony, unsuccessful investors tend to “buy the thing that’s gone up and sell the thing that’s gone down.” One benefit of rebalancing, says Malkiel, is that it “makes you do the opposite,” forcing you to buy assets when they’re out of favor and undervalued.

Incredible!\nBy the way, you can use the money for any qualified medical expense anytime, tax-free. And after the age of 65, you can spend that money on anything—say, a random trip to Santorini. Here are the things to be aware of: If you withdraw funds for non-qualified medical expenses before you’re 65, you’ll be charged a penalty. If you use your HSA funds for non-qualified medical expenses after age 65, it’s taxable.

In this case, that real estate is often Crissy Field, a waterfront park in SF’s douchiest neighborhood, the Marina District.\nWhen I’d sail by the area in my forty-foot cutter, the temptation to veer into the kiteboarders’ appropriated waters and take out a few VCs was almost irresistible. There they went zigzagging back and forth in front of the biggest natural wind tunnel in North America, ’twixt yacht and container ship. Occasionally one would tire, or get caught in his kite lines, and take refuge on a buoy. A passing boat would then rescue the drenched member of the tech elite from drowning or death by great white shark, which occasionally populated the entrance to the Golden Gate."},{"id":3672,"date":"2022-05-22 14:29:43","book":"San Fransicko","author":"Michael Shellenberger","text":"In 2020, San Francisco even paid for two billboards promoting the safe use of heroin and fentanyl, which had been created\n            by the Harm Reduction Coalition.
